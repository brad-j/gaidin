// Guards: each tool's approval rules, declared by the module that owns the tool and returned beside its
// extension. A guard says what a call asks the owner, why a call can't succeed at all, and whether the tool's
// results are text from outside. The approvals hook (approvals.ts) applies them: it refuses, asks and waits.
//
//   guard("forget", object({ id: number }), {
//     ask: (a, situation) => ifOutsideText(situation, () => `forget note ${a.id}`),
//   })
//
// Self-written tools are the exception: load_extension and remove_extension ask from inside the tool
// (self/index.ts), and so do their fetches, since those happen mid-run.
